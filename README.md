## Symfony
Made the app with Symfony 4.4.46 and used MySQL as database.

The entities are generated with make:create function.

## Twig
Twig is the tool used for the visual part of the app.

Each page of the app is a template. Edit and Create uses the same form template. The final messages are also the same template.
